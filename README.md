# vpx-DEMIWOLF

Q: What happens when you cross a SAAS idea that's been done plenty of times before (but you do it better), a business that currently engages in illegal activity in the name of liberty and justice for all, a founder who is sick of living in exile and wants to shift to a marketplace model where you're each responsible for your own choices, and an annoying animal that is part arctic wolf and part German Shepherd? 

A: I have no idea... but that founder better change this README before he realizes that libertarian and right wing extremists are a smaller market than you might think and decides to start marketing to enterprises who want to generate PDFs for things like annual reports, not print-at-home drivers licenses and preprogrammed Covid Vaccination codes... then again he might just go the ICO route on a blockchain of some sort.

PS. If anyone wants an annoying Demiwolf, he's free and extremely cute. Also highly intelligent and easily bored, like all wolf hybrids kept in captivity. So you need to have time and space for him. We have the space but not the time... because all I do is code all day... and my wife is an attorney so she's just as busy as me. But if you want our lovely Blondi please make arrangements to pick him up or transport him to your location FOB El Paso / Juarez, or San Diego / Tijuana (we live in Mexico like all good renegades should... unlike me, the animal can cross the border without any stress, just a letter from our vet which we will provide free of charge).
